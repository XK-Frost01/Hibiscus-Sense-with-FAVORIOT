# HTTPS 'POST' method
This project demonstrates how sensor data from the Hibiscus Sense board is transmitted to Favoriot’s data stream using the HTTPS POST method. Key prerequisites for using Favoriot:

1. JSON Format: All data must adhere to Favoriot’s specified JSON structure.
2. POST Method Format: Follows Favoriot’s [API documentation] (https://platform.favoriot.com/tutorial/v2/?python#data) for payload formatting.
3. HTTPS Security: Communication is encrypted (TLS/SSL), with certificates managed by Favoriot.
